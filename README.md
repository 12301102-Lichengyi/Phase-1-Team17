# Phase-1-Team17

With the development of the O2O business model, takeout on line has already come into our daily life. So our team develops the product that can publish the takeout' information and require for free people to send the takeaway for help. In this way, we can make full use of those who are actually not at home to help the restaurant to send the takeouts. Certainly, the helper can get some tips from the process when sending the takeout.
The app is just provide a platform that client gets the takeout's information nearby.And response to the requirement that the shop need somebody to send the takeout.

Audience: people those who are free at some time , and want to get a short-time but fast way to earn some money.As we know, even Bill Gates has also get 1 dollar's tip when waiting for the plane to help a lady to take care for her bag.
